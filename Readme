Sales Tax Problem
The task should be completed in Java. Console printing is fine for the outputs, but your
application should be able to parse the input as given in the example below from a source
of your choosing (e.g. file, stdin / non-interactive console input, etc.).
We expect there to be unit test coverage in line with what you believe is suitable for a
production application - i.e. we do not expect a particular style or percentage of test
coverage - use whatever you think is most valuable.
Please reply with a zip containing the source code (preferably as a Maven project), and a
text file listing any assumptions you made to solve the problem.
Take as much time as you need to complete the test although we recommend spending no
more than 4 hours. Please note the amount of time you spent on the test in your text file and
also note what you would like to have completed/added if you had more time.

Problem description
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
products which are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported
goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
When I purchase items I receive a receipt that lists the name of all the items and their price
(including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes
paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p
contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these inputs:

INPUT:

Input 1:
1
book at 12.49
1
music CD at 14.99
1
chocolate bar at 0.85
Input 2:
1
imported box of chocolates at 10.00
1
imported bottle of perfume at 47.50
Input 3:
1
imported bottle of perfume at 27.99
1
bottle of perfume at 18.99
1
packet of headache pills at 9.75
1
box of imported chocolates at 11.25


Your application should produce the following outputs:
Output 1:
1
book : 12.49
1
music CD: 16.49
1
chocolate bar: 0.85
Sales Taxes: 1.50
Total: 29.83
Output 2:
1
imported box of chocolates: 10.50
1
imported bottle of perfume: 54.65
Sales Taxes: 7.65
Total: 65.15
Output 3:
1
imported bottle of perfume: 32.19
1
bottle of perfume: 20.89
1
packet of headache pills: 9.75
